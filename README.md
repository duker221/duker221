# Hi, my name is Mikhail 👋 :computer:

I'm 22 years old and a budding front-end developer from the great city of St. Petersburg, Russia. I enjoy coding, learning new things about web technologies, and becoming a more experienced programmer with each passing day. My goal is to create modern, bright, and user-friendly websites and web applications.
When I'm not writing code, I love to listen to tech podcasts, try out recipes from world cuisines, or delve into reading books.
